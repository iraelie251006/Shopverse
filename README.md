# E-Commerce Platform

This repository contains the code for an **E-Commerce platform** built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Prisma ORM**. The application is designed to provide a modern and scalable solution for online stores, offering features such as product browsing, shopping cart management, and secure authentication.

## Features

- **Product Catalog:** Display products with details such as price, description, and category. Users can filter and search for products based on their preferences.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Optimized for SEO with server-side rendering powered by Next.js.
- **Responsive Design:** A fully responsive layout that ensures a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Secure API:** The application uses Next.js API Routes to handle backend logic, ensuring a secure and maintainable codebase.
- **Database Integration:** Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, managed with Prisma for an efficient and easy-to-use ORM solution.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** 
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework for building modern web applications.
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A strongly-typed programming language that improves code reliability and maintainability.
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework that enables fast and flexible design.

- **Backend:**
  - [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - An open-source ORM that simplifies database management and querying.

- **Database:**
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - A powerful open-source relational database system.

- **Hosting:**
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iraelie251006/Shopverse.git
cd DatabaseStarter
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

Replace your_postgres_connection_string with the connection string for your PostgreSQL database and your_secret_key with a secure string for JWT token signing.

### 4. Set Up the Database

Run the following Prisma commands to generate the Prisma client and push the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

If you are using migrations, run the following command to apply your database migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.
